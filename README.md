⭐ AskAstra – Project Overview

AskAstra is an intelligent, personalized interview preparation system designed to help students and job seekers practice and master interview skills using artificial intelligence. The platform simulates real-world interview scenarios, analyzes user responses, and provides detailed feedback to improve confidence, communication, and performance.

The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Generative AI models to generate questions, evaluate answers, and guide users across different domains such as technical interviews, HR interviews, coding interviews, and behavioral assessments. With its interactive UI and real-time feedback system, AskAstra acts as a virtual mentor that is accessible anytime, anywhere.

🎯 Purpose
The main goal of AskAstra is to eliminate the anxiety, confusion, and lack of preparation that many candidates face before interviews. Instead of memorizing answers, the system helps users practice in a realistic environment and receive actionable feedback that improves communication skills, content structure, and confidence.
